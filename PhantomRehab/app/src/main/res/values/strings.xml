        \u2022 Complete <b>at least 20 minutes</b> of mirror imagery a day, <b>every day</b>, until you no longer have any symptoms. \n
\u2022 Start with simple and basic movements before progressing towards more complex and functional movements, as symptoms allow. \n

    <string name="lr_content">Targets neurologic connections between the brain and the missing limb by having you identify body images as either left or right.\n \n
By practicing this technique, your brain uses its movement planning areas to start normalizing messages between the brain and body.\n \n
Keep in mind that the Q&amp;As are not a "test" – they can actually be fun! Try your best to not become frustrated if you are not a pro at this exercise at first. Recovery takes time and is not linear. Go easy on yourself and know that you are working toward progress. :)

    <string name="gmi_info">The brain has "maps" of the body and when an amputation happens, those maps no longer match the sensory and motor signals from the body. Graded Motor Imagery training techniques cause the brain to “re-think” the pain response that it has been experiencing since the amputation and adopt the image of the healthy hand in place of the injured limb.
